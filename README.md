This is a Repo for the Music Visualizer that will be used in sets of ONE22 and Moose.

and I want to make a music visualizer that will be used in all of the clubs in Canberra.

1. Take the first Art piece and attach the ffs analyzer to the values of the movement of the piece.
2. Take the existing art piece that is in my files and transfrom it into the art piece
3. make your own art piece based on the 1970s psychadelica 
4. fit it into a Raspberry pie (use the microphone) or HTML website
